I am a Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Meaanjin/Brisbane, Australia.

My mission is to use artificial intelligence to amplify the capabilities of expert decision makers.

My research draws on **machine learning, reinforcement learning, AI planning, interaction design, and cognitive science**, to help people to make better decisions.
I have done work on areas **including explainable AI, human-AI mixed-initiative planning**, and **human-centered decision support**.

Prior to my appointment at The University of Queensland, I was a Professor of Computer Science in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), where I was founding co-director of [The Centre for AI and Digital Ethics](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/caide). I am an honorary professor at the University of Melbourne.

If you are an organisation applying artificial intelligence or looking to apply artificial intelligence, especially in south-east Queensland, [please reach out](mailto:timothy.miller@uq.edu.au). I am always interested to hear what organisations are currently doing, the opportunities and barriers in this space, and how the University of Queensland can help.

If you are prospective PhD student interested in studying for a PhD under my supervision, [see here](https://uqtmiller.github.io/students/).
